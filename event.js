// It will log p and then div

// If we click p, we see two logs: p and div.
//  During event propagation, there are 3 phases: capturing, target, and bubbling.
//  By default, event handlers are executed in the bubbling phase
//   (unless you set useCapture to true). It goes from the deepest nested element outwards.
